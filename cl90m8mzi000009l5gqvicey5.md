Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a specific type of multi-factor authentication (MFA) that toughens  account security by verifying identity in two unique ways. In other words, 2FA is an extra layer of security  used to ensure only authenticated users gain access to a system which I highly recommend everyone  should enable.

To use 2FA, you need the following things: 
- A PIN number or a password) 
- A one-time passcode (OTP) or small hardware token, fingerprint 

## Importance Of 2FA 
I highly recommend enabling 2FA mainly for this reasons: 

**Security**: Usernames and passwords are vulnerable to attack using 2FA increases the security of your  account. Even if your password and username have been guessed correctly, hackers still need to know  the second access factor to be able to access your account. 

## Common Types Of 2FA 

- Hardware Tokens for 2FA 
- SMS Text-Message and Voice-based 2FA 
- Software Tokens for 2FA 
- Push Notification for 2FA 

## How Effective Is 2FA? 

The need for two-factor authentication has increased as individuals, and companies have realized that  passwords alone are not secure enough to protect user accounts or systems. 2FA has been implemented  to protect against Stolen Passwords, Key Logging, and brute-force attacks and secures your logins from  attackers.
